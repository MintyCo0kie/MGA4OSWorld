<p>Chapter 2 Change</p>
<p>Qin Yan paused and frowned slightly.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Just a few minutes!"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo entered the room and opened the wardrobe to change clothes.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A few minutes later, Chi Qingluo finished preparing and walked to Qin Yan carrying his bag, "I'm ready, let's go."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Qin Yan glanced at her.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A white loose-fitting sweatshirt is paired with a light-colored short skirt, and her legs are long and fair.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Her long hair was simply tied back on her head. It was strange that she was naturally pretty, so this look probably didn't suit her. But her matching and temperament inexplicably overwhelm this outfit, making it look particularly eye-catching and comfortable.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Um."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A word rolled out of his throat, and just as he was about to push the wheelchair forward, Chi Qingluo suddenly said: "I'll do it."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Since I'm wearing someone else's wife's body, I should do my duty.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>She stepped forward to push the wheelchair, but she was muttering in her heart. She didn't even notice that Qin Yan's eyes paused after she took the wheelchair in her hand, but she was thinking in her heart.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember https://m in one second. vipkanshu． vip</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This female supporting role named Chi Qingluo is really lucky. All the clothes in the cloakroom are brand-name, and there are also a bunch of bags and shoes. According to her current popularity in the entertainment industry, it is impossible to earn so much money.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Then there is only one possibility.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>All this money belongs to Qin Yan.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Since she doesn't love him, it's really unethical for her to spend his money even though she wants to sleep with someone else.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This fool, who was used as a cash machine, actually transferred all the property to her name now that she was divorced.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>For some reason, she felt a little sour in her heart. Maybe it was envy, jealousy, or maybe she felt sorry for this man.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Qin Yan was very silent and got into the car without saying a word. The car was also extremely quiet on the way to Qin's house. Chi Qingluo didn't think anything was wrong. She opened Weibo to follow the development of the information.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Just then a call came in, it was Sister Ji.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The melodious cell phone ringtone rang suddenly in the closed space, very abruptly. Chi Qingluo originally wanted to answer it, but when he glanced at Qin Yan, he found that he was concentrating with his eyes closed.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>She hung up the phone and muted it.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Sister Ji was probably angry, and she called one after another, but Chi Qingluo didn't answer any of them.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, Sister Ji sent a message directly.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>{Chi Qingluo, what do you mean? ? You refuse to answer the phone without clarifying things on Weibo? Do you want to piss me off? }</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>{Something's going on, it's inconvenient. }</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>{? ? ? Is there anything more important than you going on Weibo to clarify? Do you still want to continue to be in the entertainment industry? ah? ? ? }</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Based on the tone of the message, Chi Qingluo felt that the person named Sister Ji was going crazy and almost smashed her phone.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo's expression was calm, and he typed slowly with his slender white fingers.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>{I'll talk to you when I'm done with it. }</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>After saying that, Chi Qingluo put the phone back into her bag. Anyway, she turned on the silent mode. She didn't want to care how crazy Sister Ji would be later.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>After putting away his phone, Chi Qingluo glanced in Qin Yan's direction again.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>He still maintained his original posture with his eyes closed, his expression indifferent and indifferent, and his breath as cold as snow. They were obviously in the same place, but Chi Qingluo felt that he was not in the same dimension.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Qin family</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Master, don't be sad. Let's have a cup of tea to warm yourself up."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the huge living room, there was a lonely old man sitting.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The old man has gray hair on his temples, deep wrinkles on his face and neck, and deep-set but bright eye sockets. He is very well-dressed.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>He sighed heavily.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Don't drink."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Old man, all banquets in the world come to an end. Since the young lady has made a decision, let's respect her."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Alas." Mr. Qin sighed repeatedly, unable to say a word.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A servant came running over.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"</p>
<p>The young master and young lady are back. "</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>came back? Mr. Qin sighed a few more times. Was he coming back to say goodbye to this old man? But how come the divorce procedure is done so quickly?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Although he couldn't bear to part with his grandson-in-law, Mr. Qin still cheered up and got up.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>After Chi Qingluo got off the car, she still acted as the one pushing the wheelchair, and she moved very gently, as if she was afraid of causing any trouble to Qin Yan.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The housekeeper followed behind and felt that his eyes were about to fall out when he saw this scene.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>If he remembered correctly, the young lady never bothered to do such things in the past. Every day when she came home, she would make divorce. Mr. Qin tried to persuade her, but he finally failed to stop her.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Unexpectedly, not only did she not get divorced today, she actually pushed the young master's wheelchair in person.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Is this the good thing about finally discovering the eldest young master?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Qin Yan also felt that Chi Qingluo was a little strange today.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The whole feeling is different.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>He didn't know that his body was still the same, but his core had changed.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Luoluo..."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As soon as Chi Qingluo pushed Qin Yan into the hall, he saw an old but kind-faced old man walking towards him. With a sad look on his face, he stepped forward and held Chi Qingluo's hand.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Don't worry, even if you and Ayan divorce, you will still be my grandpa's good grandson-in-law. From now on, whenever you are in trouble, you can talk to grandpa at any time. Grandpa promises that he will protect you even if he risks his life."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo: "..."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>From what he calls himself, this should be Mr. Qin, right?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Ayan, although you and Qing Luo are divorced, do you remember to lend a helping hand if Luo Luo is in trouble in the future? No matter what, grandpa only recognizes Luo Luo as his grandson-in-law..."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As he said this, the old man actually cried sadly.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Chiqing is a little confused?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Didn't she know that Mr. Qin had this kind of character when she read the novel? I just remembered that the old man was very sad, but I didn't expect that tears burst out of the corners of his eyes.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The corner of Chi Qingluo's mouth twitched and he glanced at someone who was sitting in a wheelchair as cold as snow. The other person was unmoved and expressionless, as if he had no intention of explaining at all.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Does this leave the decision-making power to her?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo smiled and comforted Mr. Qin considerately.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Grandpa, we are not divorced, don't be sad."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Grandpa Qin's half-squeezed tears were stuck in the corners of his eyes, and he couldn't believe what he heard.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Grandpa, everything I said is true. If you don't believe me, why don't you ask him?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>So Mr. Qin turned his doubtful eyes to Qin Yan, and felt relieved when he saw Qin Yan nodding.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"As expected of my good granddaughter-in-law, come on, come on, haven't you had lunch yet? I'll ask the kitchen to prepare something delicious. Let's have a meal to celebrate."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Have a meal?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo's eyes lit up. The happiest thing in her life was eating.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Okay, let's have dinner with grandpa."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Soon, Chi Qingluo helped Mr. Qin walk inside, leaving Qin Yan behind.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>He pushed his wheelchair forward by himself.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>on the dinner table</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The cooks in the Qin family are very good at cooking. When they heard that the eldest young master and the young madam were not divorced, they immediately cooked a table of dishes, which were all delicious and delicious.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Luoluo, eat more, you are too thin."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr. Qin kept adding vegetables to Chi Qingluo's bowl.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Seeing so much food in his bowl, Chi Qingluo nodded with a smile.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Thank you, grandpa."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>She picked up her chopsticks and tasted a piece of sweet and sour pork ribs first, and then a piece of braised pork. Seeing that the Coke chicken wings in front of her were good, Grandpa Qin put a plate of braised lion heads in front of her as soon as she picked them up.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Luoluo, try this."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo naturally wouldn't shirk when it came to delicious food. As soon as she took a bite, she heard a faint reminder from Qin Yan sitting next to her.</p>
<p>"Aren't you on a diet?"</p>
