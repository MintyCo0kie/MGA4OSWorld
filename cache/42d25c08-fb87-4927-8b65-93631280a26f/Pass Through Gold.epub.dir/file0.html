<p>Chapter 1 Passing through the book</p>
<p>As soon as Chi Qingluo opened his eyes, he found that he was sleeping in the bathtub, and the cell phone placed on the cabinet next to him was ringing alarmingly.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>She leaned half of her body out of the water and took the phone.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Sister Ji?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>When did this person appear in her mobile phone? Why is she not impressed at all?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Chi Qingluo! Did you go to the bed of the Xingdu Crown Prince?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Um?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"If you want to be a monster, can you stay away from death? Don't hold me back, okay? Do you think you are not black enough? Being your manager has really made me unlucky for eight lifetimes!"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo blinked, this line sounded... why did it sound so familiar?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"You should clarify on Weibo right now! Right now!"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The other party hung up the phone immediately after yelling. Chi Qingluo sat there in confusion, not knowing what the situation was now.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>After a while, she turned her head and saw the face in the mirror.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember the website address m.vipkanshu. vip</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Oh, her eyebrows are as dark as black, her eyes are like autumn water, her skin is so fair that it can be broken with a blow, and so tender that you can almost pinch water out of it.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This face is breathtakingly beautiful.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>However, this is not her face!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Some important information entered Chi Qingluo's mind, Sister Ji, Prince Xingdu, Weibo...</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Could it be that she wore a book?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the original novel, Chi Qingluo was a stupid and arrogant supporting actress whose parents were people's policemen and died in order to save the male protagonist Qin Yan.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In order to repay their kindness, the Qin family waited until Chi Qingluo came of age and directly asked the male protagonist Qin Yan to marry her.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Originally, Chi Qingluo should have had a smooth life, but instead, she ruined him alive.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>She disliked Qin Yan. Qin Yan injured his legs in the accident and could not stand. He could only move around in a wheelchair.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo himself is a vain and pretentious person, and he can't stand that his husband is disabled. Later, he meets Su Xiyu, the handsome and wealthy prince of Xingdu, and he wants to get rid of Qin Yan and live together with Su Xiyu.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>After a successful divorce, Chi Qingluo completely lost the protection of the Qin family, and the incompetent Chi Qingluo quickly fell into the entertainment industry.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>And Su Xiyu, whom she thought was her true love, also showed his true face.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Su Xiyu was with her just to use her to get Qin's secrets. Of course he kicked her away when he was done, and also defrauded her of her money.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo regretted his mistake and went back to find Qin Yan, but Qin Yan was already with the heroine Shen Sangqiao.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Shen Sangqiao is also a little star. When he was in the entertainment industry, he was inferior to her in everything, but because of Qin Yan's love, he married into a wealthy family and became a winner in life.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As for her, she lost her life and money, had nothing, was tricked into taking drugs, and ended up dying on the street with no one around her.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>When Chi Qingluo saw that the female supporting character's name was exactly the same as his own, he almost spit out blood.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>She had a car accident on the way home, and she put on her book when she woke up, right after the heroine climbed into the bed of the crown prince of Xingdu?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>What kind of unfortunate constitution is this? Such a huge mess.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>After suddenly wearing a book, Chi Qingluo really didn't have the patience to take a bath, and she couldn't care about Weibo. The most important thing now was that she didn't know if her spatial ability would still be there after she wore a book.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Gotta try it…</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo closed his eyes and tried to enter concentration.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Ding dong——</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The sound of the doorbell drew Chi Qingluo back.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Depend on!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo gritted his teeth and stood up, grabbed a towel and went to open the door.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>There were two people outside the door, a man who looked like a housekeeper was pushing a wheelchair, and a young man was sitting in the wheelchair.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>wheelchair? Qin Yan? Chi Qingluo narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at the other person.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The man has a handsome profile and deep eyes. His aura is as cold as snow, and a touch of coldness fills his eyebrows. When those starry eyes looked towards Chi Qingluo, there was a trace of discomfort in his eyes, and then he looked away.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The air was silent for three seconds.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo remembered</p>
<p>He only had a bath towel on him, and he said with a somewhat paralyzed face: "Sorry, wait for me."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo went back to the house, found a coat, put it on, and invited people into the house.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Ahem... Young Madam, this is the divorce agreement. Except for the one where the eldest young master currently lives, all the properties with cash flows will be transferred to your name. Madam, please see if there is anything that needs to be modified. If not, you can go to the Civil Affairs Bureau to apply for divorce after signing the document."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo blinked and looked at the man sitting in the wheelchair as cold as snow.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>According to the plot development of the original novel, 'Chi Qingluo' would divorce Qin Yan. After the divorce, although most of Qin Yan's property belonged to her, it didn't take long for Chi Qingluo to be deceived by Su Xiyu.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo was still depressed just now, but he made a big mess when he walked in.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Now she feels that the situation is not that serious.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Because now the choice of whether to divorce or not is in her hands. If she gets married after "Chi Qingluo" signs her name, it will be really hopeless!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>While Chi Qingluo was thinking wildly, the housekeeper had already pushed the contract and pen in front of her.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Ma'am, please sign."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo looked at the agreement in front of him, then raised his eyes to Qin Yan, who looked indifferent.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>His face and eyes were very indifferent, as if he didn't care whether she would get divorced or not.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Chi Qingluo pushed the contract back.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The housekeeper looked at her actions with surprise and uncertainty. Is there any room for redemption?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Young Madam?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"I suddenly don't want to get divorced, is that okay?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The housekeeper was a little shocked and subconsciously looked back at Qin Yan.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Qin Yan, who had not said a word since entering the door, seemed to be in a world of ice and snow, finally raised his eyes to look at her after hearing this.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Think clearly."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>His tone was very calm, and there was no agreement or disagreement in his tone. It was purely a rational reminder.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Because Chi Qingluo had been divorced countless times before, and Grandpa Qin would persuade him every time. Finally, Grandpa Qin finally agreed and ordered Qin Yan to leave his property to Chi Qingluo.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In fact, there is no need for Grandpa Qin to tell him, Qin Yan will do the same.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>He has always been responsive to her requests.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>No reason, just because Chi Qingluo is the daughter of Qin Yan's benefactor.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"I think very clearly, if we don't get a divorce, this agreement will be void!"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Qin Yan said nothing and looked at her quietly, as if confirming the authenticity of her words.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo looked at him sincerely.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>She is a very beautiful type. Although she has just taken a shower and has no makeup on her face, her facial features are still very bright and attractive.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I don't know if it's Qin Yan's illusion, but I always feel that Chi Qingluo seems a little different today.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I can't tell what exactly is different.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>After a while, he looked away and said coldly.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"The agreement remains and will take effect anytime you want a divorce."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo was dumbfounded, so good?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>That was all the property in his name, yet he didn't pay much attention to it.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>That's right, Qin Yan has never paid attention to these external things.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>After saying that, Qin Yan pushed the wheelchair and was about to leave. Seeing this, Chi Qingluo suddenly asked: "Are you going home?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Um."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Then wait for me and I'll go back with you. I miss grandpa."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Now that she has this body, she will have to rely on it to do many things in the future. She remembers that Mr. Qin, an old man, was very sad when they got divorced, and she had to go back to comfort him.</p>
