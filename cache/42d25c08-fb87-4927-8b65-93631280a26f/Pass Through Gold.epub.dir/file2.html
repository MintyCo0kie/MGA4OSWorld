<p>Chapter 3 Plan</p>
<p>Um? ?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo paused while biting the lion's head. The original owner was on a diet?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Come to think of it, female celebrities will go on a diet in order to maintain their figure and will not even touch high-calorie foods, but she just ate a lot of high-calorie and greasy foods in one go.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Why should we diet? Our Luoluo is so thin, it doesn't matter if he gains 20 pounds. Ayan, do you dislike Luoluo for being fat?" Mr. Qin asked with a straight face, displeased.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Qin Yan, who was named, glanced at Chi Qingluo coldly. She was still struggling with the lion's head, as if she didn't care about her weight at all.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Although there were only a handful of opportunities to eat together in the past, every time Chi Qingluo wanted to eat, he had to use a lot of paper towels to absorb the oil from the food, and then eat a little bit. It was an exaggeration, so Qin Yan was deeply impressed.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Today, her behavior was unusual.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"No." He turned away and said calmly.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"That's fine. If you dare to dislike Luo Luo, grandpa will not let you go. Come to Luo Luo and eat more."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Okay, grandpa, you can eat too~" Chi Qingluo also diligently picked up vegetables for Mr. Qin.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>After eating and drinking, Qin Yan wrote back and took care of business. Chi Qingluo chatted with Mr. Qin for a while, drank tea for a while, and a servant came in.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Young lady, someone is looking for you outside."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo recalled it carefully. It was unlikely that there would be another person who could come here to find her at this time. She slowly drank the tea in the cup and raised her hand to look at the time.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>about there.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Grandpa, I still have work, so I won't be with you today. I'll come over to see you another day."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Grandpa Qin stood up immediately, "Is the person looking for you outside from work?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Well, it should be, then I'll go first, grandpa."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Okay, be careful on the road. If you need anything, call Ayan."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Qin Yan? After dinner, he was pushed back to the study. Although he and the original owner, Chi Qingluo, were married, they had always lived their own lives. Qin Yan was in no mood for love and was extremely indifferent. The original owner, Chi Qing and Luo Xin, had other interests and disliked Qin Yan.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Although there is no divorce, it is better not to get too close at this time.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo was led by the servant to the door and saw a person leaning against the car. The person was wearing a smart black suit, holding a bag in his hand and standing there with a pair of high heels. He saw her. His eyes almost burst out of fire.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo glanced at her lightly and said something before she breathed fire.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Tell me in the car."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The visitor was none other than Chi Qingluo's manager Ji Lan. Before she came here, she had almost blasted Chi Qingluo's cell phone. She wanted to go directly to settle the score with her, but her light words completely blocked her anger. Went back.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>There were only two people in the nanny's car, one was her driver and the other was her assistant Xiao Su.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Seeing her coming in, Xiao Su immediately showed a sweet and innocent smile.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Sister Qingluo."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Chi Qingluo retracted his gaze, walked toward the back, sat down, and ignored her at all.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Xiao Su's hand stopped in mid-air in embarrassment, wondering why Sister Qingluo ignored her today? Were you the happiest when you saw her before?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Ji Lan got on the car angrily and turned on the fire-breathing mode.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Chi Qingluo, do you know how serious the negative impact will be caused by your climbing into the bed of the Crown Prince of Xingdu? Do you know that my phone is being called all the time, and all the endorsement companies are terminating their contracts? They are terminating your contracts. do you know?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"It's okay to solve it. Anyway, I haven't been black for a day or two. You have to be mentally prepared before asking me to speak for you. If you don't do enough homework, if something goes wrong, you will blame it. If you breach the contract, let them pay the liquidated damages according to the contract. chant."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>After saying this, everyone in the nanny's car widened their eyes in unison.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Then he looked at Chi Qingluo as if he were seeing a ghost, in disbelief.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>But the original owner didn't think anything was wrong, and even took out a small mirror from his bag to touch up his makeup.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>She put on her lipstick while eating, and later chatted with the elderly, so she never had the chance to touch up her makeup. Chi Qingluo took out a tube of dior851 in her bag and applied it on herself.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>She applied it very seriously and carefully, and Xiao Su was itching to watch.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This berry color is particularly beautiful, but it is difficult to control. If you are careful, it may become poisonous.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>But Chi Qingluo could completely control it after applying it, and it looked even more beautiful and charming. Xiao Su was very moved when she looked at the lipstick. Although she knew she couldn't control it, she still couldn't control her greedy desire/desire.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo spoke.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Sister Qingluo, this lipstick is so beautiful, it especially matches you!"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the past, as long as she said this, Chi Qingluo would casually throw the lipstick to her and say: If you like it, give it to you. So Xiao Su felt that she would definitely be able to get the lipstick this time.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Who knew that Chi Qing and Luo Yingrun's lips curled up, and he glanced at her with a bright smile.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Good taste."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Then put the lipstick back into the bag.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Xiao Su: "..."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Those words just now were enough to surprise Ji Lan, but now her actions made Ji Lan even more puzzled. In the past, Chi Qingluo would throw lipstick to Xiao Su generously. Ji Lan also felt that she was so lavish and Xiaosu was too greedy for petty advantages, so he wanted to change her assistant. Who knew that Chi Qingluo said it was fine and would not change her.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Now what's going on?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Is this Chi Qingluo possessed by a ghost? You didn't panic at all when such a big thing happened, but you calmly said you were going to terminate the contract?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Do you know the seriousness of this matter? This matter is different from the things you have done in the past! Where is your mobile phone? Now hurry up and explain on Weibo."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"What does it mean?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"It means you didn't seduce Su Xingxi, the crown prince of Kyoto. You just went to his room to talk about work with him. There was no inappropriate relationship."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Hearing this, Chi Qingluo sneered. She had already watched the video before.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Sister Ji, do you believe that you went in and out of the room wearing so little clothes in the middle of the night just to talk about work?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Ji Lan: "..."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Why did she say it as if it was none of her business?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"There is video evidence. If you go out and make a statement at this time, it will only become darker and darker."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Sister Ji wanted to refute, but somehow felt that she was right, so she could only ask: "Then what do you think we should do?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo smiled slightly.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Nothing to do."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Rumors, if they are not true, will naturally disintegrate after a certain period of time.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Are you crazy if you don't do anything?" Sister Ji was about to explode. Chi Qingluo's nonchalant attitude made her even more angry, so she could only suppress her temper.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Xiao Su on the side also advised: "Yes, Sister Qingluo, the situation is very serious, let's explain it."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo glanced at her coldly, and Xiao Su trembled inexplicably and did not dare to speak.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo's aura is so strong today, what's going on...</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Ji Lan couldn't help it. She was someone who had been here before and could see that Chi Qingluo today was different from before, so she could only retreat and ask the next question.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Tell me honestly, do you have a plan in mind?"</p>
