<p>Chapter 5: Ask him to pay back the money</p>
<p>In the Qin family's study room, the man was working hard at the table. The cold lights in the room outlined his thin outline, and the breath on his body became colder and colder.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Ayan."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr. Qin walked in slowly and stood beside him.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"grandfather."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Qin Yan put down what he was doing, and when he raised his head, the coldness between his brows disappeared a lot, and his eyes looking at the old man became a little softer.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Um."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr. Qin nodded. Since he was his grandson, he went straight to the point.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"What happened today? Didn't Luoluo always make noises about getting a divorce?" In fact, Mr. Qin asked this without any malice, but just out of curiosity, because Chi Qingluo's behavior today was completely different from usual.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Qin Yan realized that his grandfather had probably discovered this, so he asked this question. However, he didn't pay much attention to his nominal wife, so he couldn't answer Mr. Qin's question.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"This, I'm not sure."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>He replied in a calm voice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember https://m in one second. vipkanshu． vip</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr. Qin was immediately dissatisfied: "Did Luo Luo not want a divorce at all? He just wanted to use the divorce to protest. A Yan, tell me honestly, are you not treating Luo Luo well?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Qin Yan frowned slightly. Apart from feelings, he always responded to her requests. Maybe everyone's definition of good or bad is different, but he can probably guess the reason for her divorce. It was because of an accident that the two people were forcibly tied together. Without any collision, the only thing waiting for them was divorce.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>But of course Qin Yan would not say these words in front of Mr. Qin, so as not to arouse the old man's sadness, he could only choose to remain silent.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>But Mr. Qin thought he was acquiescing and said angrily: "I knew it! You were dissatisfied with grandpa's arrangement, so you abused Luoluo, right?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr. Qin pointed angrily at his grandson.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Don't think that if you give someone money, they will be your wife with peace of mind. If you don't show your sincerity, how can someone treat you well? You were born in a family like ours and you don't know that money can buy everything, but it can't buy true love. Wait, only sincerity can replace sincerity. You go to Luoluo tomorrow and ask her to move back home. It was Luoluo who forgave you this time. You have to cherish her and be nice to her. I heard you. No?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Move back home?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Suddenly, the woman's smiling face appeared in Qin Yan's mind. She was the one who wanted to move out on her own because the company rented an apartment for her to facilitate her work.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Now let her move back home, will she be willing?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>*</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Gululu——</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo woke up from hunger. When he woke up, he took a look at the time and found that it was after nine o'clock in the evening. The room was quiet.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>She touched her stomach and went to the kitchen, opened the refrigerator, and was stunned.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The refrigerator was empty, there were no ingredients.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo called Ji Lan.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>When Ji Lan heard what she said, he slapped his head and realized: "Xiao Su was responsible for all your three meals in the past, but didn't she get fired today? Then I forgot about it. ."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo was silent for a moment, "Then I will solve it myself."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Don't eat high-calorie foods, and don't eat too much! Although you don't have a job now, you..."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo hung up the other party's phone directly, and then ordered takeout.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Fortunately, there is also a food delivery service in this world. After Chi Qingluo made the purchase, he went directly to pay, but the result showed that the payment failed.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>After checking, it turned out that the balance was insufficient.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It's life-threatening and she actually has no money? ?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo stared at the 30 yuan left in the card for a long time.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>She searched the memory of the original owner in her mind, and it turned out that last month the original owner lent all the money to the target of the scandal, the prince of Xingdu, Su Xiyu.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>She originally planned to order takeout, but now she has little money. How about some roadside snacks? So Chi Qingluo checked the map and found that there was an oden restaurant not far from here, and the hotel next to it happened to be the one where Su Xiyu lived.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Is it such a coincidence?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Half an hour later, Chi Qingluo wrapped himself tightly and went out.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That Oden restaurant is not far from her place, and it only costs 10 yuan to take a taxi there.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>She first went to the hotel to pay back the money to Mr. Su Xiyu. If he didn't pay back, she would go downstairs and buy some oden and then take a taxi home. 30 yuan was just right.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>After arriving at her destination, Chi Qingluo knocked on the door of the popular hotel room again.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Once, twice, no one came to open the door.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo was not in a hurry and continued tapping patiently.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>She was wrapped tightly, only her two beautiful eyes were exposed. Before coming out, she looked in the mirror for a long time, but she couldn't recognize that it was herself, so she went out with confidence.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>After knocking for a long time, the door finally opened.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The visitor was naked from the waist up, with a towel crookedly wrapped around his lower body, and his hair was still dripping with water, dripping down.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Almost instantly, Chi Qingluo frowned and took a step back.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Su Xiyu looked at the tightly wrapped woman in front of him and narrowed his eyes: "Who are you?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo took off his mask to reveal his identity.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"It's you." Su Xingxi's face turned ugly, and her tone became harsh, "Chi Qingluo, what do you want to do? Didn't I tell you not to come to me during this period? You can't understand human speech, right? ?I must lose my temper..."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo didn't want to waste time listening to his nonsense, so he interrupted him directly.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"What, I'm not here to find you."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Hearing this, Su Xiyu sneered: "Listen, are you talking human language? You knocked on my door and said you didn't come to see me?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo sighed, "How should I put it? I'm here to find you, but I'm not here to find you. To be precise, I'm here to pay you back."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>When Su Xiyu heard the word "repay the money", he thought he heard it wrong and didn't react for a while.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Didn't I borrow five million from you last month? I have no money to live now, so I came here to ask you to repay the money."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>However, Su Xiyu thought she was deliberately using the repayment as an excuse. After all, the woman in front of him loved him deeply and could do anything.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Chi Qingluo, you can find any excuse to stay with me." The man leaned forward suddenly, narrowed his eyes slightly, and said with an evil expression: "Don't you just want to climb into my bed?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Getting closer, Su Xiyu found that the Chi Qingluo in front of him was a little different from usual. Although she was not wearing makeup, her skin was naturally clean, fair and transparent, her long and curled eyelashes were blinking gently, and her lips were light in color. pink.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Su Xiyu felt as if his heart had been scratched by something, a little itchy and numb. His Adam's apple rolled and he realized that Chi Qingluo was actually a bit beautiful today.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>And it's the kind that attracts him.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>But Su Xiyu soon regained his senses. He knew very well what the nature of the woman in front of him was like. How could such a dirty woman be worthy of the bed of his Xingdu Crown Prince?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>If he wants to play, he will only play with things that have never been played before. She is so proactive, and it seems that there are no people to play with.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>When Su Xiyu looked at Chi Qingluo, Chi Qingluo stared at him as if he was mentally retarded. His eyes were dark and he spoke seriously.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Having said all that, can you pay me back?"</p>
