<p>Chapter 4 Black Material</p>
<p>"Silence does not mean admitting defeat, but public relations still need to be done. Let's lower the heat first."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Sister Ji thought for a while and nodded, "Okay, I will do the public relations for this matter, and I will also negotiate with the endorsement company. Now I will send you home first, and you stay at home and don't act like a monster."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo nodded lazily, leaned back casually, and closed his eyes.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Call me when you get there."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>After a while, her breathing became even.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Xiao Su and Ji Lan looked at each other, their expressions a little unpredictable.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Sister Ji, Sister Qingluo... why do you feel weird today? It seems..." It's not the same person. Of course, Xiao Su didn't dare to say this.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Shut up, would it be weird if I didn't give you lipstick?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Ji Lan slapped her face without hesitation, and Xiao Su didn't dare to speak anymore. After saying this, Ji Lan couldn't help but look at Chi Qingluo one more time.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo is indeed strange today, as if he is a different person.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>She used to panic when encountering this kind of thing, and she would do whatever she asked her to do, but now she actually came up with ideas, and her aura was so damn strong that it actually suppressed her.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember the website address m.vipkanshu. vip</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s really evil!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>When they got home, Ji Lan woke up Chi Qingluo. After catching up on some sleep, Chi Qingluo was still bleary-eyed. He put on his bag and got out of the car. Ji Lan glanced at her and finally followed her uneasily.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>When entering the elevator, Chi Qingluo was still leaning against the wall, standing crookedly, looking particularly lazy and relaxed.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"What kind of virtue?" Ji Lan glared at her: "You are a female star, can you stand well when you stand?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Well, I didn't wake up and didn't want to stand still."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Ji Lan sent her to the door of her house and prepared to leave.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"That's right." Chi Qingluo stopped her, "Please help me find an assistant."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Just as Ji Lan was about to enter the elevator, he stopped when he heard this and looked at her hesitantly.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"you sure?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo nodded.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"You didn't agree when I wanted to change it for you before, and you said she was the most popular with you. Why did you suddenly change your mind now?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo didn't answer, but opened the combination lock and entered her fingerprints to enter. Before entering, she half-leaned against the door and stared at Ji Lan.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Would you like to come in for a cup of tea?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>She was slender and tall, just leaning against the door. Because she had just woken up, her beautiful eyes were still a little worried, and her fair cheeks had a hint of enchantment, as beautiful as a flower.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Ji Lan accidentally got distracted by her beauty, and then suddenly realized, she seemed to have been seduced just now? Damn it, when did Chi Qingluo become so good-looking?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"It seems you don't need it. Good night then."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>When Ji Lan came to her senses, the door had been slammed shut, and she entered the elevator while holding her forehead.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The first thing Chi Qingluo did when he returned to the house was to take off his high heels, then throw himself into the big, fragrant and soft bed, roll on it for a while, and then get up and sit down.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>She was interrupted when she wanted to try to see if the power of space had been brought over before. Now that no one was disturbing her, she wanted to try again.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The power of space has been with her since she was born. Although she doesn't know why she has such a wonderful ability, this power of space has been with her for many years.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>She already has a deep friendship with space. If she loses the power of space by traveling through the book this time...</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo closed his eyes, and after entering meditation, he made a mantra and the surrounding scene began to change.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>After a few seconds, she successfully entered the space.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The furnishings in the space are exactly the same as before, nothing is missing, and the aura seems to be more abundant than before.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Is it because the world has changed? Chi Qingluo subconsciously picked an orange, sat down and peeled it to eat.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The mouth is full of aroma, sweet and sour, juicy. Ever since she discovered that she could grow all kinds of fruit plants in her space, Chi Qingluo planted her favorite oranges, as well as various delicious fruits, vegetables and other things. Later, Chi Qingluo also discovered that the space is full of spiritual energy. If you put things here for a long time, the items will have spiritual energy, which will also be of great benefit to the human body.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In short, regarding the ability of space, the more she explores, the more surprised she becomes. For example, if she accidentally gets injured and eats something in the space, the wound will recover faster than usual. Or if she stays in the space for a day or two, the minor injury will recover almost at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the eyes of ordinary people, these are abnormal, so Chi Qingluo has been keeping this secret well.</p>
<p>After eating two oranges, Chi Qingluo exited the space.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Afterwards, she took out her phone and looked at Weibo. The hot searches about her climbing on the bed had started to decrease little by little.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It seems that Ji Lan's work efficiency is not bad. After the hot search is withdrawn, this matter should decrease in a few days.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Ding dong——</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The doorbell rang, and Chi Qingluo frowned slightly. She had only just returned home, why was someone here again?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Just coming here, there are so many things to deal with.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo went to open the door with bare feet.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As soon as the door opened, she saw her assistant Xiao Su standing outside the door with a sad face. As soon as he saw Chi Qingluo, he rushed towards her.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo looked stern and turned sideways. Xiao Su almost fell over.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Sister Qingluo?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo leaned against the door and looked at her lightly.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Is there a problem?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Xiao Su's eyes were as red as a rabbit, and she shed tears as she spoke: "Sister Qingluo, I heard from Sister Ji Lan that you want to change your assistant. Why? Is there something I didn't do well? Why did you suddenly replace me?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I cried so hard that I felt pity for her, but it was a pity that Chi Qingluo knew her true face.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Don't you know why you were replaced?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo's eyes were a little sharper, and Xiao Su felt guilty immediately when she saw her. She stopped crying and a flash of panic flashed in her eyes.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>No, it's impossible. How could Sister Qingluo know?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Sister Qingluo, I really don't know what I did wrong... I have always tried my best, and..."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chi Qingluo wanted to see how far she could perform, but the crying look really made her upset, so he simply interrupted her in advance: "Were you the one who called the paparazzi in the hotel?"</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Xiao Su's expression changed and she opened her mouth to deny it.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>However, Chi Qingluo raised his hand to stop her.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Don't deny it in a hurry. Since I know it, it means that I have sufficient evidence. In addition to informing the paparazzi, there are also some things you think you have hidden well. If you don't want the industry to know who you are. The person will immediately disappear from my eyes."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Xiao Su froze on the spot, never expecting that the person who could manipulate someone in just a few words would suddenly become so powerful. He not only accurately pointed out what she had done, but also hit her vital points.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>If people in the industry knew what she had done, she would never want to be in the entertainment industry again.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>If she can't be an assistant, she can no longer expose information to the paparazzi in exchange for money. If she can't exchange money, what will her old mother do who is seriously ill?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>After thinking again and again, Xiao Su gritted his teeth and left despite being unwilling to do so.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>No one bothered her, and because of the dirty stuff, Chi Qingluo's work was temporarily suspended, so she went directly back to the house to sleep.</p>
